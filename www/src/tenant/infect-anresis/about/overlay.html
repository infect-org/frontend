<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
    INFECT – an <u>IN</u>terface For <u>E</u>mpirical <u>a</u>ntimicrobial <u>C</u>hemoTherapy – provides intuitive access to the latest data regarding microbes, antibiotic susceptibility and antibiotic treatment recommendations. INFECT aims to innovate patient care, reduce antimicrobial resistance, and save lives.

<h2>Data</h2>
<p>
Anonymized antimicrobial susceptibility data is provided by the Swiss Centre for Antibiotic resistance (anresis.ch). Data are provided as delivered by the participating laboratories. 
Data is updated on a monthly basis and contains susceptibility information for the previous 12 months.
</p>


<h2>User Interface</h2>
<p>
    The coloured circles displayed in the matrix represent the susceptibility of each bacterium (rows) to each antibiotic (columns). The circle size is logarithmically proportional to the sample size. Semi-transparent circles represent low sample sizes (N≤20). Data points with N≤5 are not displayed due to low data validity. The number in the center of the circle represents the percentage of susceptible samples. 
</p>
<div className="overlay__image-wrapper overlay__image-wrapper--step1">
    <img className="image--fullwidth" src="/tenant/infect-anresis/about/step1.svg" alt="Step 1" />
</div>

<p>
    According to the percentage of susceptible samples, the colour of the circle changes gradually from green (100% susceptible) to red (0% susceptible). With changes in hue, saturation and lightness we have improved usability for people with red-green colour blindness:

</div>

<p>
    When a susceptibility circle is hovered by a cursor (“mouse-over”) or tapped on a touch screen, the data’s details (susceptibility, sample size and 95% confidence interval (CI)) are displayed:
</p>
<div className="overlay__image-wrapper overlay__image-wrapper--step1">
    <img className="image--fullwidth" src="/tenant/infect-anresis/about/step3.svg" alt="Step 1" />
</div>

<p>
    95% confidence interval of the percentage of susceptibles (CI): Agresti-Coull confidence intervals with “add two successes and two failures” adjustment.
    <br/><br/>
    Sample size: number of isolates for which resistance data to the given antibiotic are available (in the respective population if filters have been set). CI is based on this number.
    <br/><br/>
    The antimicrobial treatment guideline data are based on guidelines from the Swiss Society for Infectious Diseases (SSI), published on ssi.guidelines.ch

<h1>Background Information</h1>

<h2>Current INFECT Objectives</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Provide fast and intuitive access to the latest antimicrobial resistance data for clinically important pathogens</li>
    <li>Enable data to be tailored to the local resistance epidemiology and the patients’ setting.</li>
    <li>Assist health professionals with empirical treatment choices by integrating validated antimicrobial treatment guidelines from external sources</li>
</ul>

<h2>Source Code</h2>

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<h3>Empirical Antibiotic Therapy</h3>
<p>
An empirical antibiotic therapy (EAT) is an important clinical concept and a standard procedure for the treatment of many different types of infections in clinical medicine. It describes an antibiotic therapy of an infectious diagnosis, when the  actual causative agent is yet unknown. 
EAT is based on epidemiological data of most frequently isolated pathogens and their antibiotic resistance pattern for certain diseases (e.g., S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M.catarrhalis for otitis media [middle ear infection]). The adequacy of empirical antibiotics is an important determinant of patient outcomes and plays an important role in the emergence of bacterial antibiotic resistance.
</p>

<h3>Specific Antibiotic Therapy</h3>
<p>
    Once the causative agent of an infection is known, antibiotic treatment can usually be switched to a narrow-spectrum substance to target that specific organism. This concept is described as a specific therapy.
</p>

<h3>Primary Therapy</h3>
<p>
    The antibiotic treatment recommended by a guideline as a first-line choice, including in case of special circumstances like antibiotic allergies when the generally recommended first-line choice is not an option for some patients.
</p>

<h3>Alternative Therapy</h3>
<p>
    The antibiotic treatment recommended by a guideline as an optional choice instead of the primary therapy due to non-binding reasons (eg., availability, convenience, or patient preference).
