### Empirical Antibiotic Therapy
An empirical antibiotic therapy (EAT) is an important clinical concept and a standard procedure for the treatment of many different types of infections in clinical medicine. It describes an antibiotic therapy of an infectious diagnosis, when the  actual causative agent is yet unknown. 
EAT is based on epidemiological data of most frequently isolated pathogens and their antibiotic resistance pattern for certain diseases. The adequacy of empirical antibiotics is an important determinant of patient outcomes and plays an important role in the emergence of bacterial antibiotic resistance.
